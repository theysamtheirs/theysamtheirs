		<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-2 font-brand">Design and representation</h3>
		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">As a designer navigating life with a newly deepened appreciation for my several identities and life experiences, I bring openness, curiosity, and vulnerability as core values to my design process and collaboration. I live with the belief that representation yields more inclusive and equitable products (and frankly, is required for any business to be successful today).</p>

		<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-2 font-brand">Empowering the next generation of designers</h3>
		<p class="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">This also fuels my passion for teaching and welcoming thoughtful problem-solvers from underrepresented communities and career transitioners from non-tech backgrounds into the world of product design.</p>
		<p class="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">I've spent close to 4 years mentoring up-and-coming designers with diverse backgrounds transitioning from other careers. As a career transitioner myself, I believe a new designer's greatest asset is owning their past experience and using that to inform their design voice. As a mentor, I help people refine their product-thinking skills, develop confidence in their unique history, and make sure these two things come together to produce a well-thought-out portfolio and radiate during their job interviews.</p>
		<p class="text-lg  mb-3 leading-relaxed">My past students and mentees now work at companies like Apple, Microsoft, Chegg, Slalom, Flickr, CVS and CarMax</p>
